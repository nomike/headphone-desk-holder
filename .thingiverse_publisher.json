    "description": "# Headphone Desk Holder\n\nA simple holder for heaphones, designed to be slided on your desk-edge. Could be parametrized for individual desk thickness and headphone size.\nProbably subconciously inspired by countless similar holders on the internet.\n\n## Fine tuning\n\nIf the holder is a bit too loose, you can add sticky-tape on the insides to make it fit better.\n",
