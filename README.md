# Headphone Desk Holder

A simple holder for heaphones, designed to be slided on your desk-edge. Could be parametrized for individual desk thickness and headphone size.
Probably subconciously inspired by countless similar holders on the internet.

## Fine tuning

If the holder is a bit too loose, you can add sticky-tape on the insides to make it fit better.
